🍷 Wine Quality Prediction 🍷



Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction project! 🥳 This project is all about using the power of machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. 🍇🍷



🍇 Overview
Ever wondered if a wine is "good" or "bad" just by looking at its chemical makeup? 🤔 With this project, we dive into the world of wine quality prediction using two powerful machine learning algorithms: Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). 🌟



📊 Dataset

Our dataset, data.csv, is filled with fascinating details about different wines, including:
Fixed acidity 🍋
Volatile acidity 🍃
Citric acid 🍋
Residual sugar 🍬
Chlorides 🧂
Free sulfur dioxide 🌬️
Total sulfur dioxide 🌫️
Density ⚖️
pH ⚗️
Sulphates 💨
Alcohol 🍷
Quality (our target variable) 🏆




🚀 How It Works

Data Visualization: We start by exploring the data with some cool visualizations to understand the relationship between different features and wine quality. 📈
Data Preprocessing: We clean and preprocess the data, transforming the quality scores into "good" or "bad" categories. 🧼

Model Training:

Random Forest Classifier 🌳: We train a robust random forest model to classify wine quality.

Support Vector Classifier (SVC) 🧠: We also train an SVC model, tuning its hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to squeeze out the best performance. 

⚙️Evaluation: Both models are evaluated based on accuracy and other performance metrics. 🏅
